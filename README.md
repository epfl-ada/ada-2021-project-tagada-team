# Let's Make it Popelitical
# Let's Talk about Popelitics
# Popelitical Spectrum

### Abstract
At first glance, the Pope might not be considered to have a strong impact on our everyday life and on our country’s politics, and still, he influences over 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide and regularly meet with the most powerful political figures of the planet. In the present work, we want to investigate how one of the mightiest apolitical figure on Earth [1] influences one sixth of the world population by using a novel quotations corpus : Quotebank [2]. 

### Research questions

* Can we place the Pope on a simple political spectrum (e.g. American Democrates vs Republicans) using solely the quotations ?
* What crucial features of the quotations will we need to do that ?
  * Do the usage of lexical fields along one individual's quotation corpus is enough ?
